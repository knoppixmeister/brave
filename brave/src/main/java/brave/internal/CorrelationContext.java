  // The below will be sorted into RATIONALE.md once stable
  //
  // NOTES: This design is based on cherry-picking methods available in underlying log contexts, but
  // avoiding operations that accept Map as this implies overhead to construct and iterate over.
  //
  // Here is an example source from Log4J 2:
  //
  // public interface ThreadContextMap2 extends ThreadContextMap {
  //   void putAll(Map<String, String> var1);
  //
  //   StringMap getReadOnlyContextData();
  // }
  //
  // public interface ThreadContextMap {
  //   void clear();
  //
  //   boolean containsKey(String var1);
  //
  //   String get(String var1);
  //
  //   Map<String, String> getCopy();
  //
  //   Map<String, String> getImmutableMapOrNull();
  //
  //   boolean isEmpty();
  //
  //   void put(String var1, String var2);
  //
  //   void remove(String var1);
  // }
  //
  // ## On guarding with previous value
  //
  // While the current design is optimized for log contexts (or those similar such as JFR), you can
  // reasonably think of this like generic contexts such as gRPC and Armeria
  // https://github.com/line/armeria/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/linecorp/armeria/common/RequestContextStorage.java#L88
  // https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/context/src/main/java/io/grpc/ThreadLocalContextStorage.java
  //
  // They have some design facets to help with overlapping scopes, notably comparing the current
  // value vs the one written prior to reverting a value. Since this feature was designed for
  // contexts which don't have these operators, achieving this would require reading back from the
  // logging context manually. This has two problems, one is performance impact and the other is
  // that the value may have been updated out-of-band. Unlike gRPC context, logging contexts are
  // plain string keys, and are easy to clobber by users or other code. It is therefore hard to tell
  // if inconsistency is due to things under your control or not (ex bad instrumentation vs 3rd
  // party code).
